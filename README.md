# Hiccups
Created a program equipped with a blood alcohol content calculator.

This is the project I have created. This program provides kowledge of how alcohol effeects the brain, liver, skin and sleep.
There is also a BAC calculator in an addition to an estimated calculation of the amount of fees someone would have to pay 
for the conviction of operating a vehicle under the influence of alochol.
The XML is not provided due to the fact that design is not my string point.
The creation of this program came from my irresponsible decision to drink and drive. I was the only one injured.
I'm hoping I can prevent at least one person from making the mistake I made.
Hope it helps and I am open to all ideas and/or criticism.
